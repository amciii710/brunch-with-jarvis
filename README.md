#Brunch With Jarvis

> All wrapped up here sir! Will there be anything else?

You never know when you're going to need a static webserver. Everything
in the app/assets directory gets moved over into the build directory
verbatim. No fuss, no muss.

Simply run ```brunch watch --server``` and your static site will be live at [127.0.0.1:3333](127.0.0.1:3333)
